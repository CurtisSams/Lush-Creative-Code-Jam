# Lush-Creative-Code-Jam
Lush Creative Code Jam June 2019

This was created during the Lush Creative code jam with emphasis on colours of bath bombs.

The program allows you to enter images into a list, which can then be selected
as a colour scheme for randomly drawn dots and lines to create a screen saver
effect.
It uses the turtle library for drawing, Pillow to deal with images and colours
and finally tkinter as the UI for which to interact with and watch the program.
